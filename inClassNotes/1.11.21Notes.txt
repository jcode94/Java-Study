Object Oriented Programming in Java:
Why Java? Java is a very popular, rich programming language.

Structure is a user-defined data type

class is a structure with methods

ex:

student { int id; //we can hide these variables by making them 'private'
	  char name[100];
	  float gpa;
	  //----------------
	  void print();
 	  returngpa();
	}//eval

only methods declared inside the class can access the private variables

class is the data type
object is the actual memory location where you store the variables and information

so your java program is a collection of classes while C program was a collection of functions.

When you run your java program, you will have a class and inside the class you will have your main method
  and execution starts from main. 



example java program to show construction of above shown at student.java
