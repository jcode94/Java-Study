Program consists of instructions executing one at a time.
Basic instruction types are:
	Input: A program gets data, perhaps from a file, keyboard, touchscreen, network, etc.
	Process: Program performs comnputations on that data, such as adding two values like x + y.
	Output: Program puts that data somewhere, such as to a file, screen, network, etc.
	
Programs use VARIABLES to refer to data, like x, y and z.
